Indiana finished the regular season sixth in the Eastern Conference with a 47-35 record and went on to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, falling to the Boston Celtics in four games.</p><p>Siakam was solid during his short stint with the Pacers last season, averaging 21.3 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 41 games while shooting 54.9 percent from the floor and 38.6 percent from deep.</p><p>He was just as good during the team's playoff run, averaging 21.6 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 17 games while shooting 54.1 percent from the floor.</p><p>Prior to the deal, the 30-year-old had spent the first seven-and-a-half seasons of his career in Toronto, helping the franchise capture an NBA title in 2019, in addition to securing two All-Star selections.</p><p>Now that he's reportedly staying in Indiana, Siakam will be a focal point of the Pacers' rotation alongside Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner for the foreseeable future. That will come with higher expectations for the franchise, such as contending for a top-three seed in the Eastern Conference alongside the likes of Boston and the Milwaukee Bucks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqFcn%2BMp5maZaKqurC%2B0manmquTlrluv8iaopqlXam8br%2FIoKVmaWhugq55zJqvZqiRmLKzv4ycpqesopawtXnAn6ueql2frq%2FBwKuwZqyilrGm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-savannah-chrisley-boyfriend-nic-kerdiles.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Savannah Chrisley Boyfriend Nic Kerdiles?
