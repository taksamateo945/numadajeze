According to The Wrap, after one season, executives over at Hulu had to shut it down due to poor ratings, ie, not enough viewers.</p><p>The comedian took to her Twitter account on Wednesday to say, “Well, Hulu canceled I LOVE YOU AMERICA,” and she and the rest of her workers are very disappointed. In good old Twitter fashion, however, she’ll “retweet all of the love,” the star added.</p><p>Getting its beginning in 2017, the show had one season and 21 episodes, although it was divided into two portions. Reportedly, the show as a mixture of monologues, interviews, as well as field segments designed to bring a bit of positivity to a politically polarized nation.</p><p>This won’t be the first time that a topical series has been canceled by a streaming network. Thus far, executives have wondered whether it’s even possible to have a contemporary series in an on-demand sort of fashion, however, Netflix still has The Patriot Act from Hasan Minhaj.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsWwLdxAbq3/</p><p>In 2018, Joel McHale and Michelle Wolf’s series was canceled as well. It’s important to note, however, that Hulu didn’t actually own I Love You America.&nbsp;Silverman and the company, Funny Or Die, held that role. Gavin Purcell, Amy Zvi, and Adam McKay were the ones to executive produce the series.</p><p>In a statement, Funny Or Die thanked Sarah Silverman and her entire team for doing everything they could to engage in thoughtful conversation and discussion, including the most diverse points.</p><p>Referencing some of the show’s most poignant moments, the statement alluded to the “firemen in Mineola,” as well as the blind date with a conservative lobbyist in Washington, DC.</p><p>This is just another bad batch of news for Sarah Silverman, whose friend, Louis CK, was accused of sexual assault by approximately half-a-dozen different women.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sarah later took some heat for explaining why, in her opinion, Louis did what he did. One of the accusers came out and said that Sarah had got it all wrong and that CK had irreversibly damaged her career.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejlr%2BitIysoKWulae6orrSZqBmpJ%2Brsm7Fzq5kmqWVp7akrYycmKeblaGypXnBsmShrZyqeqKy056pZqyYmnpyv9Nmqp6Zo6S7bn6SbGhubl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./he-aint-been-the-same-since-jada-august-alsina-shares-nude-bathroom-pic-and-fans-arent-impressed.html><span>←</span><span>He Aint Been the Same Since Jada: August Alsina Shares New Look, Nude Bathroom Pic and Fans</span></a>
