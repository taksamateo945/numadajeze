I’m very domesticated. I like cooking. I like cleaning. I like folding. It’s therapeutic.” The rapper said she would pick out his clothing and cook breakfast, among other things. “The things he liked, just to make sure he was happy, and he spoiled me and made sure I was happy.”</p><p>Da Brat explained that the relationship ended because the athlete had too many women. She even recalled once fighting a half-naked woman in a hotel because of him.&nbsp;</p><p>“He had a baby mama, some kids, he had a lot of stuff going on. It lasted for a good while. Both of my grandmothers loved him…It just didn’t work out. He had too many b-tches,” Da Brat said. She continued, “I think the last straw was we were sitting in the hotel, and this half-naked b-tch walks up the hallway, talking about she’s looking for him…I must have molly whopped that b*tch down the hallway.&nbsp;I said, ‘You know what, I can’t do this. I can’t do this with you.’ I just faded out, stopped answering the calls, and it fizzled out. But then I heard he was f*cking dis b*tch, dat b*tch. B*tches I knew, b*tches I was cool with. I was like ‘Nope. I’m done.’ “</p><p>Following her relationship with Allen, the 46-year-old revealed she went on to date other men and women. In February 2020, the rapper announced that she and her girlfriend Jessica had gotten engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the full interview with Da Brat and Kandi below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49yZmtsX5mubq7RmqtmqpWrsqK40maqoZ1dma61scNmmKWklaN6qsLEq6qopl2Wu6V5wZ6YrWWlpXqieceao59lnpa4prCMsKammZ5ivLex0WafoqVf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonce-talks-marriage-feminism-in-yours-and-mine-video-watch-20141212.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonce Talks Marriage, Feminism in &amp;quot;Yours and Mine&amp;quot; Video: Watch</span></a>
