It’s been 10 years since Napoleon, Pedro, and Kip created the cult classic film Napoleon Dynamite, and though the gang (and Tina the llama) still live on in our hearts, their offscreen counterparts look totally different these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the core cast then and now:</p><p><strong>Jon Heder (Napoleon)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>He’s got skills! After starring as the amazingly awkward Napoleon, Heder appeared in 2007’s Blades of Glory as a professional ice dancer and in <strong><a href=#>Kristen Bell</a></strong>’s 2010 rom com When in Rome. In 2012, he voiced his beloved character in the animated, short-lived Napoleon Dynamite TV series on Fox. He’s next set to play Roy Disney in the upcoming biopic Walt Before Mickey, which covers the early years of Walt Disney’s career.</p><p><strong>Jon Gries (Uncle Rico)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Though he was known for throwing steaks, wearing bell bottoms, and his thick head of hair, in real life Uncle Rico is a full-fledged actor (and missing almost all of his luscious locks). He has appeared on the FX show The Bridge and The CW’s Supernatural and Nikita. He also played retired CIA operative Casey in the first two Taken films alongside <strong><a href=#>Liam Neeson</a></strong>. So who cares if he took state back in ’82?</p><p><strong>Aaron Ruell (Kip)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Is he still training to be a cage fighter? In Napoleon Dynamite, Kip was the older brother no one wanted to have. He ate all the nachos, spent his days on the computer, and bragged about his relationship with his Internet girlfriend Lafawnduh. But Aaron Ruell grew up to be quite the looker compared to his nerdy character. He has appeared in several small indie films and voiced his Napoleon Dynamite character in the Fox animated series. Oh, and in August he reunited with Lafawnduh (<strong>Shondrella Avery</strong>), and it was totally awesome — see the picture below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Efren Ramirez (Pedro)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Vote for Pedro and your wildest dreams will come true! Napoleon’s bestie stole the spotlight in the hit film, and went on to have a promising movie career. He appeared in the 2006 action film Crank and 2009’s Crank: High Voltage. Ramirez also had a recurring role on HBO’s Eastbound & Down.</p><p><strong>Tina Majorino (Deb)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She may have been drinking one percent milk, but she totally could have been drinking whole milk if she wanted. Glamor shot guru Deb ended up being Napoleon’s main squeeze (he caught her a delicious bass, after all), and in real life, the former child actress (Waterworld, anyone?) became a big TV star. She has had recurring roles on Veronica Mars, The Deep End, Big Love, Bones, and is currently playing Maggie Harris on TNT’s Legends.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Haylie Duff</a> (Summer)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Vote for Summer! Since playing the popular girl whom Pedro had his eye on, Haylie Duff has appeared in several TV movies, starred on Broadway in Hairspray and Love, Loss, and What I Wore, and released her own cookbook, the Real Girl’s Kitchen. She got engaged to T-shirt business owner Matt Rosenberg in April.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Who was your favorite Napoleon Dynamite character?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOp5ipp5yavK95w7KlmqWZqbJuv9OaqaxlpJ2yr3nAp5tmpp%2BserSxxGZoaWWpmq6zv4ylmK2domJ%2FcX2TamhqaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pippa-middleton-splits-from-longtime-boyfriend-nico-jackson-details-20151010.html><span>←</span><span>Pippa Middleton Splits From Longtime Boyfriend Nico Jackson: Details</span></a>
