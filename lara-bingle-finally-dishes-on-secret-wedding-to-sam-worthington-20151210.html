After months of speculation, <strong>Lara Bingle </strong>is finally dishing on her secret wedding to <strong>Sam Worthington</strong>. The Australian model opened up about the nuptials during an interview with KIIS FM's <a href=#>Kyle and Jackie O Show</a> on Monday, Oct. 11.</p><p>"Sam and I got married nearly a year ago, on the 28th of December. It was very intimate. We just popped into Melbourne with Sam's family, and we just had 10 people in a house we rented," Bingle, 28, revealed, noting that she cooked lunch for their guests. "We wrote our own vows."</p><p>Bingle and the Avatar actor, 39, tied the knot when the mom-to-be was six-months pregnant. "I was in London right beforehand so it was really cold. But I ended up finding a white Louis Vuitton dress."</p><p>The couple began dating in September 2013 and <a href=#>welcomed their son, Rocket Zot,</a> this past March in L.A. "Being home in Sydney now is nice," Bingle told the Australian radio show. "It's nice to be home everyday, and be with my mum. Rocket has the most amazing grandmothers — Sam's mum and my mum have been awesome."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bingle also revealed that she found out Rocket's sex before giving birth. And despite motherhood being "very hard," she wouldn't trade it for anything.</p><p>"You don't get much freedom! I can't just go out, especially when he is feeding," she joked, adding that being a mum is "the best thing in the world."</p><p>Worthington is overjoyed about fatherhood, too. "Sam couldn't be happier," a source told <strong>Us Weekly </strong>in March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOaqpFir6q6xqWcZp6Zo66tuNhmm6KrmJrAbrvNZqqem6KawW7DxJ2boqaXYsGwedKapGavn6fBqbXNoKuopl1nfXKBkGtoaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10040241-report-collin-sexton-signs-4-year-72m-contract-in-sign-and-trade-with-jazz-cavs.html><span>←</span><span>Report: Collin Sexton Signs 4-Year, $72M Contract in Sign-and-Trade with Jazz, Cavs | News, Scores,</span></a>
