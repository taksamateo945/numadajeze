"He feels better," 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. When asked if Samuel's condition makes him more optimistic for his chances of playing against the Lions, Shanahan answered, "It makes me feel better."</p><p>Samuel suffered the injury in San Francisco's NFC Divisional Round win over the Green Bay Packers that caused him to be <a href=# rel=noopener>ruled out</a> of the game after halftime. Schefter <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> earlier this week that the 49ers considered it "50-50" that Samuel would be available to play in the conference title game.</p><p>The injury raised concerns for the 49ers after Samuel was forced to miss two games during the regular season with a hairline fracture in his left shoulder suffered in Week 6 against the Cleveland Browns. San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> after the Packers game that Samuel "tried to come back, couldn't do it. I know he did something similar versus Cleveland."</p><p>In his 15 games this season, Samuel put forth another strong campaign with 60 receptions for 892 yards and seven touchdowns while adding 225 rushing yards and five scores on 37 carries. His dual-threat abilities make him an invaluable piece of the 49ers offense.</p><p>If Samuel is forced to sit out against the Lions, San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy will lean on receiver Brandon Aiyuk and tight end George Kittle to lead the team's passing attack. Players like Jauan Jennings, Ray-Ray McCloud and rookie Ronnie Bell could also see an uptick in playing time.</p><p>Getting Samuel healthy will be vital to the 49ers' hopes of winning a Super Bowl this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGt%2BeHyMbXCeqqNisaaxwahkrJmdqrKtecyiqqydo2K9s63CraCcnV2strW0jKyfqK2cmbKzecinoa6qqWLBo7CMn6arZZ6bsG7AyK2jnmWXlrqm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fruit-that-is-sometimes-poached-html.html><span>←</span><span>Fruit that is sometimes poached</span></a>
