Hart joked that he has been performing for his family, but he’s been “bombing a lot,” because nobody has laughed.</p><p>Additionally, Hart explained that his hair was turning grey on certain parts of his head because the barber he goes to is closed. Hart joked that he was looking like “Morgan Freeman’s nephew.” Fans of Ellen know that she was in contact with other celebrities as well, including Justin Timberlake, John Legend, and more.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/B97_RdvBMxu/</p><p>Ellen DeGeneres, like many other television show hosts, has been spending a lot of time at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the biggest late-night television shows have ceased operations, although, hosts have chosen alternative methods instead.</p><p>Andy Cohen, the host of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, revealed yesterday that he would be going back on the air this Sunday for his next episode. He’ll be hosting the show from the comfort of his own home, and Jerry O’Connell, NeNe Leakes, and Ramona Singer will be his guests.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It’s unclear when normal broadcasting will begin, although, the president announced earlier this week that the quarantine would last just two weeks until they decide what to do next.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmsOquoyhmKusXaeyt7HApapmoJ%2Bseqmx0mainp2gnruoeceipKydnJt6o8HSsmSdraKeu6h5wqipqKaRq7azwdJmqp6klmK%2Btq3RmqWtoZ6aenSEj2xpcWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./preview-inter-milan-vs-sampdoria-prediction-team-news-lineups.html><span>←</span><span>Preview: Inter Milan vs. Sampdoria - prediction, team news, lineups</span></a>
