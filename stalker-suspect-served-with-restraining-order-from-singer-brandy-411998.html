The Blast was the first to report that the singer filed a civil harassment restraining order against a 21-year-old woman via the LA County Courts.</p><p>The 21-year-old girl has repeatedly shown up at Brandy’s home over the last few months, leaving Brandy with no other option but to take it to court.</p><p>On the 29th of Monday, the police apprehended the woman and a spokesperson for the LA Sheriff’s Department confirmed she had been detained. Authorities booked her on suspicion of felony stalking, and she’ll have to pay a $150,000 for her release.</p><p>If the 21-year-old unidentified woman is convicted of the charges, she may have to face a year in jail. According to Hot New Hip Hop, the suspicion of a felony stalking charge constitutes a crime in which a suspect follows, harasses, or stalks another person with or without the intention of inspiring fear in the targeted person.</p><p>Brandy currently lives in a gated community like many other celebrities in Los Angeles. However, she doesn’t know who the woman is, and is fearful to see her there whenever she arrives back home.</p><p>Brandy isn’t the only person who has dealt with a stalker or a home invader in recent months. For celebrities and other highly visible people, it’s not uncommon for them to become targets for mentally ill people or other people who may have malicious intentions.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCG0AL3Jovr/</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars such as Taylor Swift have had multiple run-ins with stalkers,</a> many of which have been charged with serious crimes. Earlier this year, it was reported that Billie Eilish, as well, dealt with a stalker who would show up to her home, ring the doorbell, and then sit on the step while reading a book.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>According to multiple reports, when the suspect walked up to the Eilish family home, Billie’s father said that she wasn’t there. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The man sat down on the step and read his book for a short while after.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejqa6tt8SrZKyto6WypMCMrJyrrpWZeri106Fkq52jqb%2Bitc2ipaBln6expr6Mn6mopV2otq%2BzxKtkm6qRo7G6eZNqaHJxaGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-boyfriend-jason-statham-is-my-best-mate-2015224.html><span>←</span><span>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: Boyfriend Jason Statham Is My &amp;quot;Best Mate&amp;quot;</span></a>
