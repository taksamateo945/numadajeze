Nice cans! I mean, the cans you have!” the reality star yelled in the clip.</p><p>Shep added in the video that the woman was “camera shy,” but she appeared to find it funny, according to him at least. One person screen-shotted the video and stated, “but there is nothing funny about homelessness. I’m done with him!”</p><p>When the Twitter user pointed out the way Shep supposedly treated the woman, Rose joked that he might have to take “sensitivity training 5 times a week,” as well as do hot yoga and then take a public flogging followed by four months of living in Siberia. At that point, he may be cleansed of all wrong-doing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>@Pataltschul</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@WSUDLERSMITH</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Andy</a> Is this Southern Charm? I can understand being drunk & feeling regret but <a href=# rel=nofollow>@ShepRose</a> feels none this morning. Cheap way to get “laughs” from followers but there is nothing funny about homelessness. I’m DONE w/ him <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/1SG7EjaQY4</a></p><p>— Kimberly (@KimberlyMCav) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 5, 2019</a></p><p>Responding to other people in the comments, Rose claimed he isn’t forcing anyone to follow him on social media. If they don’t like what he posts, they can simply keep scrolling, or better yet, unfollow him entirely.</p><p>This comes after rumors that Shep supposedly gave one of his Southern Charm co-stars chlamydia. LeCroy said to the reality star that she heard he was a bully and he gave his co-star chlamydia. Baird, 35, stated that it was a “lie,” and wasn’t true at all.</p><p>LeCroy went on to say that if it wasn’t true, “that’s fine.” As followers of the show know, this won’t be the first time that members of the cast have been marred by controversy.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Thomas Ravenel, one of the former stars of the show, was accused of sexual misconduct by a number of different women and was subsequently fired from the Bravo TV series.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejnbKxedGoqp5llqe8rnnSqKytoJWnu26vx5qppmWimrO2v8SsZK2nXZeupLeMnaawpl2Ws7Wx0WafnmWdlrGmecWupWanlmKubsPOppinZZOkua2xwq2gp59dmK6vv4xsZ3FwaGp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10123369-video-knicks-josh-hart-jokes-about-haliburton-pacers-getting-swept-by-celtics.html><span>←</span><span>Video: Knicks' Josh Hart Jokes About Haliburton, Pacers Getting Swept by Celtics | News, Scores, Hig</span></a>
