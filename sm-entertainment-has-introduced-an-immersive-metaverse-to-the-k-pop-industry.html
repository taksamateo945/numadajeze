It has now set out to grow its metaverse by building a studio dedicated completely to all of this, while also solidifying its position in metaverse development. The agency announced the formal establishment of STUDIO KWANGYA, a metaverse production technology firm, on July 12. It has several divisions such as VFX production, Virtual Human, Virtual Studio, VR Production, and so on. Since delving further into the SMCU (SM Culture Universe), the agency has guaranteed that all SM artists are included. The newly formed studio would provide the agency with more autonomy over its VR and SMCU initiatives.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#SMentertainment</a> launches metaverse content production technology company, ‘STUDIO KWANGYA’!

SM Entertainment is one of several that helped to begin it and, in doing so, established a complete metaverse of all of its artists. The agency just announced the formal inauguration of STUDIO KWANGYA on July 12. It is a studio mostly dedicated to SMCU-related material.</p><p>Furthermore, the agency collaborated with Amaze VR, a virtual concert platform. They unveiled a collaborative company called Studio A, which is believed to be the start of the Kwangya universe.</p><p>According to Korea Joongang Daily, Amaze VR co-CEO Seung-joon said,</p><p>“The creation of Studio A will result in large-scale VR concerts for worldwide performers that the public will never have seen before.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SM-Entertainment-1.jpg alt="SM Entertainment" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It also intends to launch immersive and entertaining worldwide VR concerts. Meanwhile, SM Entertainment’s Lee Sung-soo and Tak Young-joon provided further information on the studio’s history and values.</p><p>“SMCU is a concept that bridges the virtual and real worlds and embraces each artist’s unique tales and worldviews.” And the world encompasses each artist’s identity as well as the place that transcends them. It also symbolizes a new universe in which they cohabit without borders. Studio Kwangya was founded to generate unique metaverse contents based on Culture Technology.”</p><p>The studio will also house SM Entertainment’s hybrid content project, CAWMAN. The agency trademarked the term CAWMAN last year. Cartoon, Animation, Webtoon, Motion Graphic, Avatar, and Novels are all abbreviations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/STUDIO-KWANGYA-1.jpg alt="STUDIO KWANGYA" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lee Soo-man, the founder of SM Entertainment, said in an interview that he wants South Korea to be a leader in the metaverse globe. The firm is often referred to be a trailblazer since it introduces never-before-seen innovations in the K-pop industry.&nbsp;It will be interesting to see how Lee Soo-man takes STUDIO KWANGYA to new heights, as well as the variety of VR projects the studio has in the works.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqpmWVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBbrTArGSipqSnvKXBwp6bZpmeYrauucSrqqKulWK6psDAr5yrq5ViwbB506GcZqNdpbyxecinm66rpKfGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-nelson-movies-and-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>10 Best Sean Patrick Thomas Movies and TV Shows</span></a>
