S. Eliot’s 1939 poem “The Naming of Cats”. He is a principal character and the main narrator in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1981 musical Cats, which is based on Eliot’s poems.

This is particularly evident in the orchestrations for the songs, which sounds incredibly tinny and dated.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_the_cats_in_cats_dead></span><strong>Are the cats in cats dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Some of these include a ritual sacrifice, which certainly makes Cats’ ending less happy. Another is that the <b>kitties in Cats are actually in purgatory</b>, and that the Heaviside Layer is the real heaven. Clearly it’s up for interpretation, which is why moviegoers may be puzzled by the ending of Tom Hooper’s Cats movie.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_munkustrap_and_Rum_Tum_Tugger_brothers></span><strong>Are munkustrap and Rum Tum Tugger brothers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In some London productions, and presumably those derived from them, he is depicted as the <b>sensible older brother</b> of Rum Tum Tugger and despairs of his wild sibling.

Rumpleteazer is <b>a supporting character in the 2019 Cats movie</b>. She is portrayed by Naoimh Morgan. The movie character is darker and more sly than her somewhat goofy stage counterpart, but still retains a mischievous and carefree personality.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Taylor_Swift_do_all_her_own_dancing_in_Cats></span><strong>Did Taylor Swift do all her own dancing in Cats?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She’s only appears in two scenes of the universally slated musical Cats. But it seems that Taylor Swift, 30, <b>had a body double for her scenes</b> as Bombalurina, as actress Annabelle Strutt revealed she was a stand in for the singer on set.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Cats_the_worst_movie_ever></span><strong>Is Cats the worst movie ever?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Cats was the big loser</b> at this year’s Golden Raspberry Awards, which are given to the year’s worst movies.
