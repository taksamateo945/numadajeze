We’ve seen them get a gold medal and three silver medals and it’s the best they’ve done since the 1984 games in LA. So, since they’ve become one of the most talked about swim teams, it’s about time we get introduced to everyone and what they participate in.</p><h3>Let’s start with, 100m breaststroke gold medalist; Adam Peaty!</h3><p>Adam Peaty won the 100m breaststroke, setting a good standard for Team GB. It was a very emotional moment when the medal was won, letting the whole of Britain wake up to good news! Peaty also took part in the 4x100m relay which team GB got silver in!</p><p>One of the most amazing things about Peaty’s success is that when he was little, he was scared of the water.</p><h3>Jazmin Carlin</h3><p>Jazmin came away from her swimming events with two silver medals. These came from the Women’s 800m Freestyle and Women’s 400m Freestyle. As like the others, Jazmin did Team GB very proud with her performance in the pool!</p><h3>James Guy</h3><p>After narrowly missing out on the Men’s 400m Freestyle and 200m Freestyle, James Guy did come away from his events with two silvers. These two silver medals came from Men’s 4x200m Freestyle relay and Men’s 4x100m medley relay! Very good member of Team GB, very hard worker.</p><h3>Francesca Halsall</h3><p>Although, Francesca did miss out on getting any medals at these Olympic games, she did the team proud! She took part in the Women’s 50m freestyle and the Women’s 4x100m relay. She got to the final in both of these events but unfortunately just missed out on medals!</p><h3>Siobhan-Marie O’Connor</h3><p>Siobhan-Marie O’Connor was quite a remarkable character for Team GB’s swim team! She came away with one silver medal from the events which was in the Women’s 200m Individual Medley.&nbsp;She is the first British woman to win a medal in this swim as she got the British record of 2:06.88.</p><h3>Duncan Scott</h3><p>Duncan took part in many events and came away with two silver medals! He proved what he had in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay and the men’s 4x100m medley relay! But, he also took part in men’s 100m freestyle but just missed out by scoring fifth overall!</p><h3>Hannah Miley</h3><p>Hannah didn’t take any medals away from the games but she did take part in a few events! She took part in women’s 400m individual medley, women’s 200m individual medley and women’s 4x200m freestyle relay! She came so close to taking a medal but just missed out. Never the less, she did the team very proud and is a great edition!</p><h3>Chris Walker-Hebborn</h3><p>Chris took part in a few swimming events and came away with one silver in the 4x100m Medley Relay. He was a very important part in the victory for Team GB in the race! As well as playing a vital part in the 4x100m Medley Relay, he also took part in the Men’s 100m Backstroke.</p><h3>Daniel Wallace</h3><p>Daniel came away from his time in the pool with a silver medal! Daniel was part of men’s 4x200m freestyle relay where Team GB came away with the silver medal. He also took part and got to the final of the men’s 200m individual medley but just missed out on a medal!</p><h3>Robert Renwick</h3><p>Robert was also part of the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay! This means he helped bring Team GB to victory with it and helped them take the silver medal! He didn’t take part in any other events but was a strong force for the swim team!</p><h3>Benjamin Proud</h3><p>Benjamin, although didn’t come away with any medals, put up a good fight in his events! He took part in the men’s 100m freestyle and 50m freestyle. He didn’t quite qualify when it came to the 100m freestyle but just missed out on a medal in the 50m freestyle by coming forth!</p><h3>Chloe Tutton</h3><p>Chloe Tutton was very unlucky as she didn’t win any medals but she did put up a very good fight! She took part in women’s 100m breaststroke, women’s 200m breaststroke and women’s 4×100 medley relay.</p><h3>Ross Murdoch</h3><p>Ross took part in the men’s 100m breaststroke. Unfortunately, he didn’t quite qualify for the finals of the race but did very well in the qualifier and semi-finals!</p><h3>Aimee Willmott</h3><p>Aimee didn’t take away any medals in her competitions in swimming but is a strong part of Team GB. She competed in the women’s 400m Medley and women’s 200m butterfly. She ranked fifth in the women’s 400m medley and didn’t quite qualify for the 200m butterfly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktKbAjKSlqK9dpbKwvMueZJudmJ67pXnTnpimZZeXwG6%2F1qKkZqyVlrpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-fill-in-work-at-offices-html.html><span>←</span><span>Did fill-in work at offices</span></a>
