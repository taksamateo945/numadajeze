Matt’s former wife, Amy Roloff, and his children, twins Zach and Jeremy, Molly, and Jacob, assumed the farm, land, and business would go to the children as an inheritance, but their assumptions, regardless of many conversations with Matt over the years, did not come true. Jeremy even tried to make an offer to buy the north side of the farm, but he was turned down. During season 22, Zach and Matt entered negotiations for the north side of the farm, but Matt also rejected his offer. In the end, Matt wanted an outrageous amount to sell the house to his children, or he was putting it on the market.</p><h3>Little People Big World Spoilers – The Eventual Sale</h3><p><a href=#>Matt ignored his children</a> wanting to take over the farm and put it up for sale for whopping $4 million dollars, “all of @rolofffarms has brought me and our family great joy for the past 30+ years! Today 16 acres of the farm’s 109 acres go up for sale including our original family home and bright red barn, it’s a tiny bit scary but mostly exciting … it’s time to move toward the next season of life.” The next season of his life was to get engaged to his girlfriend and former farm hand, Caryn Chandler. The couple is planning their wedding for 2024, and with that, Matt is building himself another house to live in with her.</p><p>The sale went nowhere, Matt pulled it off the market and turned it into an Airbnb charging $651 a night.</p><p class=p1><img alt="Matt Roloff" width=800 height=418 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/04/little-people-big-world-spoilers-matts-failure-causes-roloff-farms-to-be-dissolved/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Little People Big World Spoilers: Matt’s Failure Causes Roloff Farms To Be Dissolved" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LPBW-Matt-and-Caryn.jpg></p><h3>Little People Big World Updates – A New Turn</h3><p><a href=#>In a surprising turn of events</a>, the US Sun is reporting that Matt failed to submit an annual report this year and the business is now listed as “inactive.” This really is strange since Matt has already teased that pumpkin season on the Roloff Farm in 2023 is a go, “yes, pumpkin season is happening this year.”</p><p>Inactive doesn’t mean the farm is shut down, but it does mean, “those who do business with an unregistered assumed business name may not have standing in court to pursue or defend legal actions. They also may find it difficult to do business, for example, getting licenses, opening bank accounts and entering into contracts.”</p><p>This whole mess begs the question, did Matt do this on purpose? Does he have an end game? What do you think?</p><p>Stay tuned to Little People Big World on TLC and keep <a href=#>checking here frequently for all the latest news, updates, and gossip about all your Little People Big World cast and spinoffs!</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49tZqWhpKm5pnnPnqappJVir6qzjLCmq6SUYsCxu8ilnKurXaKutcDSZp2aoZyqv6Z5wpqsrJ2jYr%2BwuM6fnWaekae6tHnTqGSbnV2ZtrS%2FzqWtnpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aleem-releases-christmas-cover.html><span>←</span><span>Aleem Releases Christmas Cover - CelebMix</span></a>
