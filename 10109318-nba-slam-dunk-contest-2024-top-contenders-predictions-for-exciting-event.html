Who says All-Stars don't dig the dunk contest? OK, a lot of them bypass the event, but not Brown, who's the first All-Star to participate in this event since DeAndre Jordan in 2017.
Brown's name recognition alone should add some extra weight to this year's contest, but he's a certified high-flyer with a real chance of winning. He routinely punishes the rim with impressive force during games, but it will be interesting to see what he can pull out of his creativity bag."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

OK, a lot of them bypass the event, but not Brown, who's the first All-Star to participate in this event since DeAndre Jordan in 2017.</p><p>Brown's name recognition alone should add some extra weight to this year's contest, but he's a certified high-flyer with a real chance of winning. He routinely punishes the rim with impressive force during games, but it will be interesting to see what he can pull out of his creativity bag.</p><p><b>Jaime Jaquez Jr., Miami Heat</b></p><p>Jaquez has been among the most productive rookies in this class, as evidenced by the fact that he snared the first two Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month awards handed out this season. While his on-court game often revolves around mastery of the sport's subtleties, he still has plenty to his rim-rocking arsenal.</p><p>He may not always play the flashiest game, but he can have some fun with this. It sounds like he may <a href=# rel=noopener>have something special</a> cooked up for this event, and we can't wait to see it.</p><p><b>Mac McClung, Osceola Magic (G League)</b></p><p>McClung may not be on an NBA roster at the moment, but credit the league for recognizing he needed to be involved. He was too dynamic at last year's event not to include him.</p><p>McClung has incredible bounce, and he clearly knows how to perform under this spotlight. Last year, three of his four dunks earned perfect scores, and all of them were completed on his first attempt.</p><p><b>Jacob Toppin, New York Knicks</b></p><p>The younger brother of 2020 lottery pick, Obi Toppin, Jacob Toppin is the least recognizable name in this field. He technically has a two-way contract with the Knicks, but he's logged just 15 minutes over four big league outings to this point.</p><p>Obi won this event in 2022, and Jacob has a chance to follow in his footsteps. He has the kind of effortless bounce that lets him show off in games, so the imagination runs wild with what he might do in this setting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6AcoSMp5maZaOhrq55w66lpGWTpLu1sdKtZGtoYml6tbvPZpqopqSau6Wx0axkqaqVmbakwMiopaxllqS%2FbrHXnKCtoZ6ceqbCxKer</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shocking-incident-robbery-and-shooting-outside-jg-melon-restaurant-in-new-york.html><span>←</span><span>Shocking Incident: Robbery and shooting outside JG Melon restaurant in New York</span></a>
