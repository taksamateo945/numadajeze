With four games still remaining, Inter went 13 points clear at the top of the table last weekend, matching their tally for the whole of last season – when they finished a point behind now-deposed champions Juventus – and putting the final seal on their first championship triumph since the spectacularly successful Jose Mourinho era."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Though he was not on the scoresheet last time out, the 22-goal Belgium centre-forward played his part in a 2-0 success against Serie B-bound Crotone – a result which, when combined with Atalanta’s failure to win a day later, ultimately sealed the club’s 19th Scudetto.</p><p>Now unbeaten in 18 league games – their longest such streak in a single season since 2008 – Inter have swept clear of the chasing pack since the turn of the year and, having clinched glory by the first weekend in May, can now close in on a potential 94-point total by gaining revenge on Sampdoria – the last team to beat them in the league.</p><p class=imgI><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.imgix.net/21/07/claudio-ranieri.jpg title="Sampdoria manager Claudio Ranieri pictured on January 30, 2021" alt="Sampdoria manager Claudio Ranieri pictured on January 30, 2021" width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=article_img_copyright_body><span class=article_img_copyright>© Reuters</span></span></p><p>Now with 45 points accrued after last Sunday’s success against fast-fading Roma, ninth-placed Sampdoria have already overtaken their tally from the entire 2019-20 campaign.</p><p>In recent weeks, the Blucerchiati have blossomed – pushing into the top half of the table courtesy of a run of three wins out of four – and are currently six points clear of Udinese, in 11th, coming into the weekend.</p><p><a href=# title="More Claudio Ranieri"><strong class=autotag>Claudio Ranieri</strong></a>‘s men were good value for their 2-0 win over the struggling Giallorossi last time out, as they enjoyed more of the ball and more shots on goal than their supposed superiors at Marassi.

Undoubtedly, a repeat of January’s 2-1 home win would prove the ideal way for Ranieri and company to spoil the hosts’ raucous title party.</p><p>Inter Milan Serie A form:</p><ul class=fg_results><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_draw title=Draw>D</span></li><li><span class=fg_draw title=Draw>D</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li></ul><p>Sampdoria Serie A form:</p><ul class=fg_results><li><span class=fg_draw title=Draw>D</span></li><li><span class=fg_loss title=Loss>L</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li><li><span class=fg_loss title=Loss>L</span></li><li><span class=fg_win title=Win>W</span></li></ul><p>Article continues after the advert</p><h2 id=team-news>Team News</h2><p class=imgI><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.imgix.net/20/51/christian-eriksen.jpg title="Christian Eriksen in action for Inter on December 13, 2020" alt="Christian Eriksen in action for Inter on December 13, 2020" width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=article_img_copyright_body><span class=article_img_copyright>© Reuters</span></span></p><p>As Inter have few injury concerns ahead of Saturday’s game, their starting XI could remain relatively unchanged, with Antonio Conte unlikely to take his foot off the gas in the final four games.</p><p>Only veteran pair <a href=# title="More Aleksandar Kolarov"><strong class=autotag>Aleksandar Kolarov</strong></a> (thigh) and <a href=# title="More Arturo Vidal"><strong class=autotag>Arturo Vidal</strong></a> – who is still struggling to return to full fitness after knee surgery – are set to be sidelined again.</p><p>Italy midfielder <a href=# title="More Stefano Sensi"><strong class=autotag>Stefano Sensi</strong></a> was offered a rare opportunity to start last weekend, but <a href=# title="More Christian Eriksen"><strong class=autotag>Christian Eriksen</strong></a> will prove a strong contender for his berth in the Nerazzurri engine room.
