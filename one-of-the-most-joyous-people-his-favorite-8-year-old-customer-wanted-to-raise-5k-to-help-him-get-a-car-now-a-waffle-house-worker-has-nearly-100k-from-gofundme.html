He had saved up some money for a reliable transportation to work, but was forced to use the money he had saved up to move his family to a motel room.</p><p>“All my tips and everything that I get to go straight to my kids,” Gardner said. “I pay for the room, daily pay $60 a day, and it’s just eating my pocket alive.”</p><p>The Hunter family created the account after they discovered Gardner was walking to work everyday and his family were living in a motel room due to the mold and rat infestation in their home.</p><p>“Devonte said he wondered if anyone might know where he could buy a cheap car — he’d been having a&nbsp;hard time saving for one,” Kayzen explained to&nbsp;The Washington Post.</p><p>The initial goal of the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> fundraiser</a> was to raise $5,000 but as of today it has reached $96,933 and counting. It has received over 2,600 donations from people, including several anonymous donations of $500 and one person gave a $2,000 donation.</p><p>“Devonte is one of the most joyous and positive people you’ve ever met!! He always greets us with the biggest smile. I hope your heart is as BIG as mine and you will help me spread kindness in the world. Any amount helps,” Kayzen said at the end of his GoFundMe post.</p><p>Gardner expressed that the generosity received for him and his family almost made him cry.</p><p>“It just be a blessing,” Gardner expressed to local media. “You know, I’m always counting my blessings, always.”</p><p>Kayzen’s dad, Korey Hunter, stated that the family doesn’t expect anything from this but to be a blessing to someone in need.</p><p>“Kayzen does not want anything in return. Just wants other people to pay it forward,” Korey Hunter said.</p><p>The $96K raised will help Gardner move his family to a new home and help him get a family car.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49sZmltX6S7pnnOn2StoJViurC%2F02ahqLGfqsBuvMSop6WdXZ22tHnFmq2oqpmpsm6EjLKcmqpdpLmlecKuqq2nnZq%2FbsPAp6uenF2pvG6%2BwKKqnmVloHq1u4yhnKWoXZ22rnnGnqtmmV2YrrN5zaiuZpldrK6nssueZKGnpaiybsPOq6Keql2drrR5zZ6Yq6SpYn5xfMpmnaunnWK0sLLUp5umnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-russell.html><span>←</span><span>Bill Russell - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
