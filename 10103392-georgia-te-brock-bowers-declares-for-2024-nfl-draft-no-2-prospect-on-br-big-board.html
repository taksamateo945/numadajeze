"The two-time national champion, who led his team in receptions and receiving yards during both of those runs, has one-of-a-kind vision and movement skills in the open field for a tight end prospect. He's also spectacular at the catch point."</p><p>Bowers arrived at Georgia as a 4-star prospect in the class of 2021, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports'</a> composite rankings, and more than lived up to expectations during his collegiate career.</p><p>He helped lead the Bulldogs to two College Football Playoff national championships with 175 catches for 2,538 yards and 26 touchdowns in 40 games throughout his career.</p><p>Bowers dealt with injuries this past season, which prevented him from building on his individual momentum after he posted more than 120 yards and scored in three straight games during the middle of the season against UAB, Auburn and Kentucky.</p><p>But he will surely be one of the most notable players in the draft and has the talent to be an immediate contributor for whichever team selects him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGiAen6MoJyoqpeerm7AxGaZq6eToHqju9aeqaxllJqwra3Rnqpmnp%2BnenN8kW1kp56cYrGzrcWtZKenXWd6sb7OrKeem6RivK95watkm6GXYq%2BwrdGd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alexandra-patton-meet-davis-riley-wife-married-life-and-kids.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who Is Alexandra Patton?
