Y'all beat us Game 7, whatever, y'all mad hype," Hart said. "Y'all couldn't get one win? After three leads in the fourth? Obviously if we moved on, [Jalen Brunson] wouldn't have been playing, I would have tried to play, I don't know how I would have been. Damn, we could've did that...

Though Hart gave Haliburton a hard time for the sweep, there wasn't much the star point guard could do as he missed the final two games of the series while dealing with a hamstring injury.</p><p>While Indiana couldn't get it done against Boston this year, both the Knicks and Pacers seem capable of competing for a championship in the near future.</p><p>New York is hitting its stride with Brunson leading the way, but injuries kept it from reaching the next level this season. Indiana also showed plenty of promise this year and seems capable of making the jump as Haliburton continues to grow as a player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiAd4WMr6CdnZ9iuK%2B1wqSqZqKfqLVutMCrq2ain6CytHnAm6aurF2drq21wa6praeeYr2ir8SrqmaflanBqrrGZqqwnaCpeqPFjJycpayZmMA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-moennig.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Katherine Moennig Height, Age, Bio</span></a>
