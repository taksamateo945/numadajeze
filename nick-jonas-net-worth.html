He was born on September 16,1992 in Dallas, Texas. His mother is Denise, who began her career as a sign language teacher. His father is Paul, a songwriter and musician who was once an ordained minister in a church. Though he was born in Dallas, he was raised in New Jersey. He and his three brothers, two of whom are older and one who is younger, were all taught at home by their mother. Nick Jonas was a star from a very early age. He was only six when he accompanied his mother to a salon for a haircut and was discovered by a talent agent who referred him to a show business manager. By the time he was seven, he was performing in roles on Broadway.</p><p>He spent many years working in some of the most famous productions on Broadway as a child actor, and he then wrote a song when he was only ten with his father. The song was performed during a “Beauty and the Beast” performance and it was a huge hit. The entire cast sang together and it went live on a Christian radio station and suddenly he was a household name with a huge following in that genre. It was only two years later when the people at Columbia Records heard the song and asked him to sing for them. He was a solo artist for many years before he and his brothers decided to go ahead and form a group of their own called The Jonas Brothers.</p><p>The group was not very well-received after their first album dropped in 2006 and they were dropped from the label. It was then that they were signed with Hollywood Records as a group. The three oldest brothers worked for a while to make it big in the music industry, but they were not having much luck until they were tapped by the Disney Channel for a short series about their group. The boys were so cute that<a href=#> the Disney Channel</a> decided to do a movie called “Camp Rock,” in which the boys were the stars. That was it for them; every single little girl and teenage girl in the world fell madly in love with them and they were suddenly at the same status as other more famous boy bands. They were a legend.</p><p>Nick Jonas and his brothers had several successful albums and worked hard to make it as a group before splitting up in 2012. He is now working on a solo project and making huge hit, and he is the most famous of the three brothers with the most successful solo career. He has Type I Diabetes, and he is a young man who really enjoys the ladies. He’s dated Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and even Delta Goodrem. He’s also dated Olivia Culpo. His solo career has taken off and he is a huge hit, so he will only continue to increase his net worth.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGilopubYrewusCsZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelorette-star-blake-horstmann-is-dating-love-is-blind-star-giannina-gibelli-report.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelorette Star Blake Horstmann Is Dating Love Is Blind Star Giannina Gibelli (Report)</span></a>
