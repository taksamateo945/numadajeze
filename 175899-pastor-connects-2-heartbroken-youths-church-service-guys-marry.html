A moment these two will never forget.</p><p class=align-left>They shook their heads no, and the pastor decided to introduce them to each other.</p>“You guys should start talking,” the pastor said, as the congregation erupted in laughter. “Hold her hand,” he added, as he moved the young man closer to the young woman.<p class=align-left>The two looked shy and awkward but followed the pastor’s instructions. A love found under the roof of God, one many are praying, lasts a lifetime.</p><p class=align-left>The pastor then asked them to exchange contacts, which they did and announced that they would marry.</p><h2>Woman’s passion during church service goes Twitter viral</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News, </strong>a video on <a href=#>Twitter</a> of an older woman<a href=#> in the church</a> caused a buzz. People were in awe of the video as the lady's faith was evident while praising God in church.</p><p class=align-left>Online users commented to share their two cents about it. People noted that the woman reminded them of their family churches.</p><p class=align-left>A post on Twitter by @nampree went viral as it showed a woman doing the most in church. The video shows her singing a church hymn with a lot of passion.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>TUKO.co.ke</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLi70aWbaJmWp7akrY5qbm5waW56sa3SraarZZOku6%2Bxwq2qZmpdnbKivtObqaijlaN6urvUrZ%2BsZZOdwrOvx2aqnqqmnrCmecausKxlnZa%2Fs8WO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jey-one-hkfs-html.html><span>←</span><span>Carta natal astrolgica de Jey One (Rapero) 2024</span></a>
