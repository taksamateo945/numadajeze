<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Six people we'd love Demi Lovato to collaborate with</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In our <a href=#>recent interview</a> with Demi Lovato, the songstress revealed that we can expect some collaborations on her forthcoming album. She said: “yeah you’ll hear some collaborations on the album. There aren’t any set in stone yet but I definitely have people that I talk to that I want to work with.”</p><p>Whilst nothing is confirmed yet, it got us thinking about who we’d like to see Demi collaborate with. Having previously worked with artists as diverse as Cheat Codes, We the Kings, Cher Lloyd, Olly Murs, and Brad Paisley, the possibilities are endless!</p><p>Our wish list is enormous, however, we’ve narrowed it down to six Demi Lovato collabs we need in our lives.</p><h4>Ariana Grande</h4><p>Can you just imagine how heavenly this collaboration would be? Both artists are powerhouses, so combining the vocal talents of Demi and Ariana would surely result in something absolutely electric. During a recent chat with iHeart Radio, Demi named Ariana as an artist that she respects and mentioned that they’ve discussed collaborating in the past. There’s no time like the present ladies!</p><p>https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/891329336082608128</p><h4>Ed Sheeran</h4><p>Mind that time Demi covered Ed Sheeran’s ‘Give Me Love’? We still get goosebumps thinking about it. We’ve already had a taste of what a Demi x Ed collab would sound like after the pair performed ‘Give Me Love’ live at&nbsp;MYfm’s MYBigNightOut. However, we NEED more! It’s a collab which has been talked about for a long time now, with a lot of the pair’s fans completely on board. So guys, please give us all what we want!</p><p></p><h4>The Chainsmokers</h4><p>Demi’s last two collabs have been dance orientated, and whilst her forthcoming album will be more soulful, we wouldn’t rule out further EDM collabs in the future. She recently joined The Chainsmokers on stage, and we’d love to see Demi team up with Alex and Drew for a track! The ‘Closer’ hitmakers have featured several females on their tracks so far, including Halsey, ROZES, Emily Warren and Daya. We’re certain that Demi and The Chainsmokers would create something special.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love you guys!! Thank you always for your support and inviting me to hop up on stage with you last night <a href=#>@TheChainsmokers</a> ?? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VsdjfBSN1R</a></p><p>— Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) <a href=#>July 15, 2017</a></p><h4>Bruno Mars</h4><p>Y’know when you’re happily scrolling your Twitter timeline and you come across something you never knew you needed but all of a sudden your world makes sense? That’s how we felt when we stumbled upon this mash up of Demi’s ‘Sorry Not Sorry’ and Bruno Mars’ ‘That’s What I Like’. With the songstress going down a more soulful route, a Demi x Bruno collab would be absolutely golden.</p><p>https://twitter.com/shayftdevonne/status/889201612509655040</p><h4>DNCE</h4><p>This is a collab which would certainly give us all the feels. Demi and DNCE are such great pals, and they’ve already performed together in the past which was electric. We can’t forget the undeniable chemistry between Demi and front man Joe Jonas either. During their 10+ year history, they’ve performed together so many times so we know their voices suit perfectly. Their ‘This Is Me’ Camp Rock duet remains iconic to this day. Throw in Jack’s incredible drumming, JinJoo’s guitar slaying and Cole’s crazy antics on bass, and you’ve got yourself a future masterpiece.</p><p></p><h4>Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez</h4><p>Demi, Miley and Selena are the original Disney trinity and we’ve always had a need for a team up in our lives. We’ve already had a taste of what a collab would be like after they worked together (along with the Jonas Brothers) on the charity single ‘Send It On’. Most recently, the trio have been slaying the charts individually with their offerings, so imagine the impact if they teamed up for the ultimate girl power anthem? We’re pretty certain that the internet would implode and we’d be okay with that.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/six-people-wed-love-demi-lovato-to-collaborate-with-01.jpg alt width=1023 height=659 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h4>Who would you like to hear Demi Lovato collaborate with?
