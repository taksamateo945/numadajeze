She is back on tour and on Friday, June 7, 2019, kicked off the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Party‚Äù run with a show at The Forum in Los Angeles. After the event, she shared photos on her official Instagram page and a video featuring her 11-year-old daughter Esme singing on stage with her.</p><p>It was later confirmed that this was Esme‚Äôs first time performing on stage. The video went viral and fans were amazed to see how much like Jennifer Lopez Emme truly is.</p><p>In the video, you may see as Jennifer is wearing a long red dress that cascaded in ruffles and culminated in a full skirt. Jennifer‚Äôs dress was sleeveless and she wore minimal jewelry. Her long golden hair was sectioned at the crown and pulled away from her face while the rest fell over her shoulders. Emme wore a matching skirt with a long sleeve, red blouse and stood next to her mother on stage.</p><p>Both held their mics and were in perfect harmony as they sang Jennifer Lopez‚Äôs song ‚ÄúLimitless.‚Äù J-Lo became visibly emotional when Emme‚Äôs voice trailed to the high notes at the end. The mother and daughter embraced tightly after the performance.</p><p>J-Lo turned to the audience and gave them a look of knowing approval, pride, and awe at how gifted her daughter was. With Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony for parents, it‚Äôs no surprise that Emme is gifted.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez captioned the video with the following hashtags.</p><p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it! #Emme #Limitless#ProudMama #JLoItsMyParty.‚Äù</p><p>Jenna Dewan left the following comment.</p><p>‚ÄúOhhhhhhh my goodness üòçüòçüòçüòç.‚Äù</p><p>You may see the video of Jennifer Lopez and her daughter Emme singing below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BydGMuHghzs/</p><p>Jennifer Lopez shared another photo from the concert where she wore gold boots, a metallic bodysuit and was photographed bending backward with her hair splayed out behind her.</p><p>The photo went viral and had more than 600,000 likes and over 4,000 comments, many of which praised Emme for her vocal skills.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BycW-61gT2G/</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What did you think of Jennifer Lopez‚Äôs and Emme‚Äôs song together?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3nDmrGzpJWoeqq6jKecsGWkpMKzec%2Bhpq2nXaWys7LOq6SsZZ%2BjerTAwKCcZq%2BZqbVuucinoGallWKxosHGoaueql2auq6xjGtwaWxkanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-herren.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Chris Herren Net Worth.
