Even while choking himself in the music video at 1:35 mark, Puth sounds sensational as always!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/charlie-puth-unveils-i-warned-myself-from-upcoming-album-02.jpg><p>In the visual, directed by Brendan Vaughan, Charlie Puth serves up plenty of sombre glances as he sings about an intoxicating relationship; “You mess with my heart/ Now you’re the reason why/ I Warned myself that I shouldn’t play with fire/ I can tell that I’ll do it one more time”. “I Warned Myself” is about a vicious cycle of going back to someone continuously, knowing deep down that they aren’t any good for you.</p><p>Charlie took to social media to announce his latest release.</p><p>He did a YouTube live video and later posted on his Twitter and Instagram accounts to make the official announcement for the release of his latest track “I Warned Myself”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“I WARNED MYSELF” IS OUT WEDNESDAY. THE VIDEO COUNTDOWN STARTS AT 8AM WEDNESDAY ON YOUTUBE. ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YMomsRkiSp</a></p><p>— Charlie Puth (@charlieputh) <a href=#>August 19, 2019</a></p><p>He also shared that he is “putting out three songs instead of one” on his twitter account and “I Warned Myself” is the first in the set. He shared the song’s artwork in his announcement which is a black-and-white close-up shot of his face. The “Voicenotes” singer then promoted a countdown and shared some behind-the-scenes footage with producer Benny Blanco on his Instagram story series.</p><p>“I Warned Myself” is Puth’s first solo track since dropping Voicenotes last year, He has most recently collaborated with 5 Seconds of Summer aka 5SOS on the remix version of the track “<a href=#>Easier</a>” where he even co-wrote a couple of lyrics. He also co-wrote Katy Perry’s latest release “Small Talk.” The music video has already garnered over 2 million likes in less than 12 hours of release which is remarkable.</p><p></p><p><strong>We can’t wait to see what’s next lined up in the series that’s going to be served to us by Puth.
