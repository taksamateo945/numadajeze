Despite those choices, teams are still high on the former Heisman Trophy winner, trusting his work ethic heading into his NFL career.</p><p>"But it's believed Williams has too much dedication to the game and becoming a great player to veer off course," Howe wrote. "Another unknown element that's been broached is how Williams will adjust to a pro style offense, but that's the case for most prospects."</p><p>Williams' decision to skip some aspects of the combine is somewhat unusual, but he explained his thought process on Friday, per Yahoo Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Jori Epstein</a>.</p><p>"Not 32 teams can draft me," Williams said. "There is only one of me. So the teams that I go to for my visit, those teams will have the medical and that'll be it."</p><p>In 2023, Williams threw for 3,633 yards, 30 touchdowns and five interceptions while adding 136 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground. His numbers were down from his Heisman campaign in 2022, but the dip likely won't hurt his No. 1 overall chances. In 2022, Williams had 4,537 passing yards, 42 touchdowns and five interceptions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaBdnyMq5ypp6Kpeq%2Byy2arnpmdqHqywcSsq6KnnpqxbrXFZpqapJWXeri1y6WgmqWjYra0ecGeoKefXaXCrbjEnWSipl2pvLB5zJqlsmWUnr%2Bmr9Oipqer</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-there-a-real-danny-collins.html><span>←</span><span>Is there a real Danny Collins?
