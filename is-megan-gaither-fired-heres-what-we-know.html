Here's What We Know About The Missouri Teacher's Instagram And Pictures</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>English teacher and varsity cheerleading coach at St. Clair High School, Megan Gaither, has been put on leave after being caught selling porn on OnlyFans. This is the second time a teacher from the same school has been caught selling explicit content on the adult entertainment website. The news has sparked controversy and raised questions about the school’s policies on teachers’ side hustles.</p><p>Gaither’s OnlyFans account was discovered by a student who shared it on social media. The post went viral, and the school authorities were quick to take action by putting her on leave. However, Gaither has expressed her desire to return to the classroom and continue teaching. She claims that she was using OnlyFans to supplement her income and that it was a private matter that did not affect her teaching abilities.</p><p>The incident has raised questions about the school’s policies on teachers’ side hustles and whether they should be allowed to engage in such activities. While some argue that teachers should have the right to pursue other interests and earn extra income, others believe that such activities can negatively impact their professional image and affect their ability to teach effectively. The controversy has also sparked a debate about the use of social media by teachers and the need for schools to have clear guidelines on the matter.</p><h2><span id=Is_Megan_Gaither_Fired>Is Megan Gaither Fired?</span></h2><h3><span id=Details_of_the_Incident>Details of the Incident</span></h3><p>Megan Gaither, a 31-year-old English teacher and varsity cheerleading coach at St. Clair High School, was placed on leave last week after her OnlyFans account was discovered.

Some people believe that her personal life should not affect her job as a teacher, while others argue that her behavior is inappropriate and goes against the values of the school.</p><p>Many of Gaither’s supporters have taken to social media to express their support for her.
