Several eyewitnesses spotted a resemblance between Kane and the Zodiac Killer.</p><p>The sister of a victim claimed that a man resembling Kane had previously bothered her sibling at a restaurant, a police officer who caught a glimpse of the killer after one of his attacks agreed that Kane bore a resemblance to the murderer, and a woman who may have escaped from the Zodiac Killer also picked out Kane’s image as her would-be abductor.</p><p>What’s more, a French engineer named Fayçal Ziraoui claimed in 2021 that he’d <a href=# rel=noopener>cracked two of the previously unsolved ciphers</a> that the Zodiac Killer had sent to the San Francisco Chronicle. And according to Ziraoui, one appeared to spell Kane’s name, hinting at the Zodiac Killer’s identity.</p><p>Ziraoui believes that cipher Z13, which begins in English with the phrase “My name is —” can be decoded to read: K-A-Y-R. To many online sleuths, this seems tantalizingly close to “Kane” or “Kaye.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-405350 alt="Cipher Z13" width=600 height=777 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cipher-z13.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-405350 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Cipher Z13 begins with the phrase “My name is” before trailing off into the Zodiac Killer’s coded language.</span></p><p>Kane served in the Naval reserves, where he could have learned to write coded messages. And Voigt <a href=# rel=noopener>writes on his Zodiac Killer website</a> that Kane suffered from brain damage following a 1962 car accident, which reportedly left him unable “to control self-gratification.”</p><p>However, many criticized Ziraoui’s findings after he released them online in 2021. Since investigators have failed for decades to solve the Zodiac Killer’s remaining ciphers, many expressed doubt that Ziraoui could crack the code so quickly and easily. “When he says that it took two weeks to crack the Z32 and an hour for the Z13, I think that sums it up pretty well,” one online commenter wrote, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to The New York Times</a>.</p><p>Kane, who died in 2010, took any secrets he might have had about the infamous murderer to his grave. But when it comes to the question of the Zodiac Killer’s identity, there are still several other intriguing possibilities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4tM5mrpqrXam1pnnZqJuimZNiuKq4y56paGw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./and-or-or-not-in-logic-crossword-clue-nyt-1025380.html><span>←</span><span>AND, OR or NOT, in logic Crossword Clue NYT</span></a>
