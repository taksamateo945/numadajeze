Season 5, Episode 4 saw Summer and Beth riding giant sperm monsters, Morty fertilizing his sister’s egg, and a Sperm Queen literally kicking everyone’s butts. It was… yeah. It was a lot.</p><p>But in the midst of all that madness and grossness there was one surprising celebrity cameo. Bet you never guessed Kathy Ireland would appear in Rick and Morty. Wondering who was actually behind that cameo and the wife of the fictional Blazen? Here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2>Was Kathy Ireland Really in Rick and Morty Season 5, Episode 4?</h2><p>Yes, there was an animated version of Kathy Ireland in “Rickdependence Spray.” Though she has appeared in adult animated comedies like Family Guy and King of the Hill, cartoon Kathy Ireland wasn’t voiced by the actual model and actor-turned-entrepreneur. Instead, another big name was behind her character.</p><h2>Who Voiced Kathy Ireland in Rick and Morty?</h2><p>That would be Christina Ricci, who also voiced Princess Ponietta. Plot twist, right?</p><h2>What Else Has Christina Ricci Been In?</h2><p>Ricci first broke onto the scene at the age of nine thanks to Mermaids. That success was soon followed by The Addams Family and Casper, cementing her as a child star in the world of Hollywood. Fitting for this perverse episode, she also starred in the provocative Black Snake Moan.</p><p>More recently Ricci starred in Grey’s Anatomy in 2006, The Lizzie Borden Chronicles in 2015, and Amazon’s Z: The Beginning of Everything in 2017. Ricci is also the national spokesperson for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Later this year Ricci is expected to star in The Matrix 4.</p><h2>Who Is Kathy Ireland Married to in Real Life?</h2><p>Ireland isn’t married to a seemingly badass warrior named Blazen. She’s married to physician Greg Olsen, and together they have three children. We bet he’s much cooler than Blazen-the-easily-killed.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where to stream Rick and Morty<br></a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnop6wrHnAp5tmpZ%2Bnwbp51qGmZq6fnrCmv4ykmK2gqWK2s7HLmqWdZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carrie-beth-van-dyke.html><span>←</span><span>In Pictures : Carrie Beth Van Dyke, Dick Van Dykes Oldest Daughter &amp;amp; What Does She Do?</span></a>
