This business recently made waves in the news, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news. While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this news event, we work to verify that the content you see here reflects personal consumer experiences with the business rather than the news itself. As a result, we’ve temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page. You should feel free to post your thoughts about the recent media coverage for this business on Yelp Talk at any time.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7i6mU_pgyS/</a></p><p>Meanwhile, White took to her Instagram to post-and-delete a comment that said: ‘Thank you to the audience that is mature enough to understand my honest intentions and that can take honesty.
