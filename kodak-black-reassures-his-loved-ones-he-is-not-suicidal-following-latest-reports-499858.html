Though I get that it’s the job of the blogs to report everything… when it comes to a person clearly battling mental health issues, they should be off limits. Idk… I hope he gets what he needs to be better.’</p><p>Someone else said: ‘He should be able to vent and talk about he’s feelings and depression. Why is he apologizing for? Normalize black men expressing their feelings.’</p><p>A fan said: ‘Stop making people feel bad for what they feel . It’s okay if you did feel that way,’ and one other follower posted this: ‘He said what he said.

He needs that and to clear his conscious & spirit. He has been through a lot & he needs support + good energy. A lot of people out here are swapping out materials for love and you can’t. Love is what MAKES you rich. You can lack on everything else but if you have LOVE – you can overcome anything. Praying for this black man because everyone deserves a clear mind & great mental health.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Stay tuned for more news.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebpLGit4ybo5qbm2K%2Fpq3SrKyrnaNitaq%2FjKWmr52UYryvsdJmn55lmah6r7vTZqquoZOesaK4jJ%2BmpaSfrLavs4ylmK2do6l6s7HPqKmtq11phnqElHFm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-rollag-freeman-sd-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Rollag Freeman SD Accident: What Happened to Megan Rollag?</span></a>
