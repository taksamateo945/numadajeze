JUSTIN’S fans also bought the song. OUR fans bought the song (never more than four copies each, AS THE RULES STATE). they’re ride or die motherf***ers and i thank god every day i have them in my life. not only when they fight for us to win but because they are some of the greatest people i know.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAOO55HFAxS/</p><p>She went on to also say in part that: ‘sales count more than streams. you can not discredit that as hard as you try. to anybody that’s displeased with their placement on the chart or who’s spending time racking their brains thinking of as many ways as they can to discredit hard working women (and just the women for some reason…..), i ask you to take a moment to humble yourself. be grateful you are even here. that people want to listen to you at all.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAV8BJJn4Y4/</p><p>In a video he later posted, the rapper complimented Ariana calling her ‘talented and beautiful.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, he also responded to her request to be more humble, arguing that it is not her place to say something like that to him since she will ‘never understand [his] pain.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRp7aiusBmnquZnpmybr7ErKeoppSoerW7jK2cpJmjnbZugsixcKKmlah6pLjAoqSsZaOdsm6tzZ1km6Gcoa%2BwrdGdZKaZnp69trjArZydZaSdsm6vx5qpratdqbxus8StZJ2tlal6uLXToWSjraOptq95waKcm52iYq61edOhnGasn6V6dIWXbmxrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-and-morty-who-voices-kathy-ireland.html><span>←</span><span>Rick and Morty: Who Voices Kathy Ireland?</span></a>
