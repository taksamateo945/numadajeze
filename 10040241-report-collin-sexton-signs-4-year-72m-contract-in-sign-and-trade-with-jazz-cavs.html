When he was healthy and playing, he averaged 16.0 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.0 three-pointer made per game while shooting 45.0 percent from the field and 24.4 percent from long range.</p><p>Cleveland selected him with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft out of Alabama, and he was coming off a career year statistically entering the 2021-22 campaign.</p><p>In 60 games during the 2020-21 season, Sexton averaged 24.3 points, 4.4 assists, 3.1 rebounds, 1.6 three-pointers made and one steal per contest while shooting 47.5 percent from the floor and 37.1 percent from beyond the arc.</p><p>While he was excellent individually, it didn't result in winning basketball for a Cavs team that struggled to a 22-50 record and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive season.</p><p>They were much better collectively in 2021-22, going 44-38, which may have been the impetus behind moving on from Sexton.</p><p>Another possible reason for the Cavaliers' willingness to trade Sexton is the presence of Darius Garland, who is a similar player in many ways.</p><p>The Cavs selected the 22-year-old fifth overall in 2019 out of Vanderbilt, and he broke out with a career year in Sexton's absence, averaging 21.7 points, 8.6 assists, 3.3 rebounds, 2.6 three-pointers made and 1.3 steals en route to his first career All-Star selection.</p><p>Cleveland also acquired guard Caris LeVert in a trade with the Indiana Pacers this past season, making Sexton even more expendable.</p><p>After trading All-Star center Rudy Gobert to the Minnesota Timberwolves and Mitchell to Cleveland, the Jazz will have a decidedly different look and appear to be loading up for the future.</p><p>Sexton is still young and has plenty of untapped potential, so he could be the bridge from some growing pains in the immediate future to contention a few years down the road when Utah's young assets start to develop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZGV%2FdX2Mq5ypp6KpeqS7y6Wgp2WjmsW1u81mqqKfnqh6dXnYnpirZWdnum6vzqerq5mTqXqquoysoKCmXZa7pXnTq5idnV2strW0jKOYs7JdmK63vw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carl-gugino-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Carl Gugino Jr. Celebsgraphy</span></a>
